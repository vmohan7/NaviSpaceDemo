# NaviSpaceDemo

This is a small demo to show case the basic rotational and touch capabilites of the Navi SDK. It along with the Navi SDK are licensed under GPLv3.

## How to play

Once you have done the tutorial that is included with the Navi SDK, you will be transported into space with several jelly monsters rotating around you and one in your slingshot. Using rotation you may control where the slingshot aims. If you drag on the touch screen, you can pull the string back and release it to fire the jelly. Aim at the floating orbs to gain points, you can even hit the sun!

## Contributing

I would defintely love to add more features/gameplay to this demo and make it look a lot more polished. If you have suggestions or ideas, feel free to fork the project and submit a pull request.
